# Immersed_in_the_sound_of_space
Our challenge was to design a method to create sonifications of 3D NASA space datasets.



# Running the python script
To run the python script first you must ensure that required libraries are installed.
To install run command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can run the script by using command with input video argument:
```bash
python sonify.py {input_video_filepath}
```
If you need to modify something else, you can try changing the code.
